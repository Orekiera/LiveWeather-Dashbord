# 📊 Live Weather Dashboard

## 📁 Project Overview
The **Live Weather Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI project that shows real-time weather data from multiple cities. It uses live data from a weather API and turns it into a clear, user-friendly dashboard using Power BI Desktop.

This project helps showcase skills in:

- API integration  
- Data transformation (ETL)  
- Dashboard design and storytelling with data  

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- Power BI Desktop  
- Weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap)  
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations and KPIs  

## 📌 Key Features
- Real-time temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions  
- City-wise comparison of weather metrics  
- KPI cards highlighting key weather indicators  
- Interactive slicers and filters by city, condition, and time  
- Clean and professional dashboard layout  

## 📂 Dataset Details
- **Source:** Live Weather API  
- **Format:** JSON (parsed and transformed in Power BI)  
- **Parameters included:** City Name, Temperature, Feels Like, Humidity, Wind Speed, Weather Description, etc.  

## 🧠 Insights Gained
- Compare weather conditions between different cities in real-time  
- Identify drastic temperature differences and wind patterns  
- Understand weather metrics easily through clean visuals  

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Open `Live_Weather_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.  
2. If needed, update the API key or data source parameters in Power Query.  
3. Refresh the data to fetch the latest weather information.  
4. Explore the different visualizations and filters.  

## 📁 Files Included

- `README.md` — This documentation file  

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add forecasting charts for 3-day or 7-day weather outlook  
- Deploy on Power BI Service for live cloud-based reports  
- Integrate Google Maps or Bing Maps visuals for geolocation display  
- Schedule automatic data refreshes for continuous updates
